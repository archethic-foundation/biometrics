## No one will be able to steal your keys, you will be able to delete them, but you will never forget or lose them. 
- Tamper-proof authentication 
- No key storage (GDPR by design)
- Vital signs monitoring
- Learning morphological changes
- Designed for the world population

### An authentication that cannot be used without our knowledge
Unlike fingerprints, irises, or faces which can easily be reproduced and falsified
from a photo on Facebook or in the street - it is impossible to reconstruct the
inside of a finger. The device checks vital signs during each authentication to
ensure that the finger has not been cut off and that the person is fully aware and
consenting before any transaction validation.

### Without key storage
All current biometric identifications are based on the same principle: 
- capture of biometric data and storage of that recognition data (pattern) 
- comparison of the measurement with the pattern 
- if the match exceeds a certain threshold then the person is identified (software) 
- Identification by the biometric device is no longer based on a recognition threshold and therefore no longer needs to be stored for comparison. As shown in the figure above, private cryptographic keys are generated on the fly (and then deleted), allowing the user to retrieve and decrypt their decentralized "key ring". Tolerance on identification is ensured by the learning mechanism described on the right. Finally, authentication is no longer software but cryptographic, making any attempt of software attack useless. 

### An authentication of the world population independent of the system
Unlike biometric identification on a smartphone that will only work on one smartphone -AE Biometrics authentication works for any person and on any device. As no keys are stored, it is compatible with the most stringent data protection regulations (GDPR, CNIL, etc.), making biometrics available for large-scale use.

### Automatic lifelong learning
As shown in the figure above, the keys are generated in pairs from the biometric measurements. If one of the measurements is different (cut, burn, etc.) then only one key will match and can validate the authentication while the two new keys will be added to encrypt (via associated public keys) the decentralized key ring, thus learning a person's new biometric measurements without ever having to store the keys.
